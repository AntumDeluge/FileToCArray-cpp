# File To C Array

## Description

**File To C Array** is a tool that generates a C array from the contents of any file. Such arrays can be used as a way of embedding resource files into an executable binary, gaining access to the resource files without having to use platform-dependent code. The tool requires [Nana C++ Library](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana) in order to build, but you can download a binary release below.

Protip: if the output file the you choose is the same as the input file, it will automatically get renamed like in the screenshot above.
